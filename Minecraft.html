<h2>Minecraft Live 2023!</h2>
<p> Minecon Live 2023 is coming up and here you can find all the information you need to know!</p>
<h3>Mob Vote!</h3>
<p> Every year there are three mobs that players can vote on to get into Minecraft, so far only two have been announced but they all look like good choices! <br><b>The Crab</b> You can find the Crab in mangrove swamp biomes and when killed they drop a crab claw. crab claws let you place blocks from further away! <br><b>Armadillo</b> You can find the armadillo in hot areas like savanna biomes when you kill these they drop scutes which you can use to craft the new armor for your dog! finnaly you dont have to sit your dog down when you fight in fear of them dying!<br><b>Penguin</b> you can find the penguin in the stony shores biome and penguins act as dolphins grace but for boats!</p>
<p><b>Dates To Remember</b></p>
<p>With Minecraft Live 2023 coming up, its not easy to remember all the dates so we wrote them down for you!<br><b>October 15th</b>, the most important one! This is the day Minecraft Live, goes live! tune in at 1:00 pm est in order to find out what the new update is going to be! you'll also find news on minecraft dungeons and legends and you will find out what new mob will join minecraft!<br><b>October 13th</b>, this is when voting starts, you will have 48 hours to cast your votes! you can vote from <a href="https://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft.net</a>, the minecraft launcher, and the special event for bedrock! hopefully it will be as fun as the last one!</p>
<p><b>Speculation</b></p>
<p>so disclamer real quick this is, well speculation it might not happen in game but it is fun so lets get into it!<br>in the video introducing the crab, it shows the crab walking up a tree like a spider! this would be a cool mechanic and thanks to xisumavoid for bringing this up!<br>in the video introducing the armadillo tiny vu bumps into the armadillo like its a block, it would be super cool if we had a mob that could turn into a block, think of the redstone!<br>in the video introducing the penguin it looked like it could retrieve items but more interesting than that, it looks like penguins can dive and slide and that would be so cool!</p>
<p><b>Credits & More Info</b></p>
