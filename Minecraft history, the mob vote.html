<h1>Past</h1>
<p> The Minecraft vote started out rough people had the choice to vote on what new feature gets into Minecraft! and of course, the people voted for the phantom, which everybody hates but after that people voted for the taiga biome which not everybody hates then, people voted for the glow squid which I am fine with even though I didn't vote for it, and then we had the choice between the copper golem the glare and the allay and the allay won! lastly in last year's mob vote, we had the choice between the sniffer the rascal, and the tuff golem. The sniffer won! this year the choices are the armadillo the penguin and the crab who do you think will win?</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p> The future looks grim for the Minecraft mob vote the community is trying to end it and get all three, I don't know about you but the best thing for me in Minecraft live is the suspense, is the mob I voted for gonna win, I would be okay if this gets in, and false promises that if the glow squid wins your quitting Minecraft. i feel like if we got all three it would just be the new update, and they probably would only add one mob anyway! i am just saying that the mob vote is nice to have and I would be sorry to see it go, but either way, the new update is the biggest thing, do you think that it would be something the community has been asking for like the end update or something that didn't get voted on last time like the birch forest update, or even something new? think about that, tell others, keep the hype up!</p>
