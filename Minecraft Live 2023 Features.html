<h1><b>Blocks!</b></h1>
<p>
the new update without a name has been announced! and it has some amazing features!<br><b>The Crafter!</b> AUTOCRAFTING!!! We have been asking for this for a while you can enable/disable slots and you can put a bunch of items in and activate it with Redstone and it will spit out the crafted item! you can also feed them in through hoppers they crafted a sword and a hanging sign, I can't wait to see it in the game!<br><b>Grate!</b> It is a new variation of the copper block that oxidizes and looks like a good block for industrial builds!<br>Speaking of industrial, The <b>Copper Doors/Trapdoors!</b> these look awesome and I look forward to using them in-game!<br><b>The Copper Bulb!</b> this new light gets dimmer as it oxidizes! and looks awesome for ambiance!<br>The <b>Tuff bricks!</b> they are like stone bricks but they look more cartoony and I love it, I can't wait for trial chambers!<br> Another thing coming is the <b>Trial spawner!</b> the trial spawner looks for how many people are nearby and spawns mobs accordingly they also spawn different types of mobs like strays, and once you finish killing them all it gives you a reward depending on the number of players we saw diamonds and emeralds and then it goes on cooldown and you can use it again! it seems to me you can make a diamond farm! exiting!
</p>
<h2><b>Mobs!</b></h2>
<p>
With those amazing blocks we have some good mobs too!<br><b>The armadillo!</b> the armadillo won the mab vote this year sorry to those whose mobs didn't win but we already went over this one, see my other posts<br><b>The Breeze!</b> this one can be found in the trial chamber and can change the state of interactive blocks like levers and trapdoors! I can't wait!<br>
those are all of the confirmed features thanks for an amazing Minecraft live!
